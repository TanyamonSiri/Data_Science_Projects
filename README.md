In data science bootcamp with 6 months intensive program, we've learnt 10 sprints which are in-demand skills to be an Entry-level Data Analyst. Therefore, all my consistent homework and projects are as follows:

## 1. Spreadsheet



* [Dynamic Query](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/DynamicQuery.jpg)
* [Converting TH to ENG Date](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/Convert_TH_to_EN_Date.jpg)
* [ID Card Parser](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Spreadsheet/IDCardParser.jpg)



## 2. Database SQL 
A simple restaurant database created with `SQL` consists of 5 dimension tables and 1 fact table, as well as an ER-diagram and some queries for data analysis. This project is published in [Replit](https://replit.com/~), which is a powerful platform for creating and sharing software. I also create the ER-diagram of my restaurant database to show the relationships between tables available in this database.

* [ER-diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63d8d697296d97641d7d4acc)



## 3. R Programming
The Rule-based Chatbot is created to assist users in choosing Thai food üçΩÔ∏è and playing an interactive rock-paper-scissors game üïπÔ∏è. This project is created with `R` and published in Replit, with an objective to manage input data using control flow and function to provide pre-defined replies.

## 4. Data Transformation with R
Using the `rvest` package to scrape data from two different web page (IMDb & VLR.gg), along with regular expression and `dplyr` package to transform it into usable format.

* [Source Code](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/DS_Bootcamp_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Transformation/Data_Transformation_Web_Scraping.r)

## 5. Data Visualization with R
A report with 5 visualization from `diamonds` dataset, using `ggplot2` to explore this dataset and create `R Markdown` document. Note that
`diamonds` is a built-in dataset in ggplot2 library that containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 round cut diamonds.

## 6. Statistics

## 7. Machine Learning for Data Analyst

## 8. Intro to Python Programming
Use `Python` to create a interactive chatbot for pizza ordering and play rock-paper-scissors, as well as `OOP` (Object Oriented Programming) knowledge to create an ATM class with five methods: deposit, transfer, withdrawn, update password, and summary bank account. Moreover, the final project in exploring and analyzing sales data with `Pandas` is also included below.

* [Homework Python 101 with OOP](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Analyst/HW_Python.ipynb)
* [Sales Data Analysis with Pandas](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Analyst/Course%20Pandas%20Foundation%20-%20Final%20Project%20.ipynb)

## 9. Essential Python for Data Science
Use `request` to get data from [the Cocktail Database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api)üçπ which is a public API and export to .csv file. Along with use `sklearn` algorithms to build 3 machine learning models which are LinearRegression, RandomForest and DecisionTree.

* [Homework of Essential Python Class](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Analyst/HW_Essential_Python.ipynb)

## 10. Dashboard
Use `SQL` to query essential information from [Summer Products & Sales Performance](https://data.world/jfreex/summer-products-and-sales-performance-in-e-commerce-on-wish), then use Looker Studio and Tableau Public to generate a report and dashboard.

* [Raw Data](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/SQL%20for%20dashboard/summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv) & [Query Data](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/SQL%20for%20dashboard/merchant_performance_query.csv)
* [Merchants.sql](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Data_Science_Projects/blob/main/SQL%20for%20dashboard/merchant_performance_query.sql)
* [Merchants Performance Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tanyamon.sirikanjanakul/viz/MerchantsPerformanceDashboard/Dashboard1) - `Tableau Public`
* [Merchants Report on Wish Platform](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0d9c4a9a-6337-4dc3-8da2-f924996e3194) - `Looker Studio`
